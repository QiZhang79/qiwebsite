      Hi, my name is Qi Zhang. I'm a currently a  graduate student majored in 
      Information Architecture. And I hope to be a web designer after I graduate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I studied Advertising during my undergraduate period. Although I was not 
      an engineer or science background student, my interdisciplinary background 
      still helps me a lot.
      For instance, my undergraduate major experience helped me to develop a 
      sense of choosing attractive things, which pushed me to keep high 
      standards for my own web design.
    </p>
    <!-- TODO:picture here-->
    <p>
      I have two important turning points for my career goal. The first one 
      happened in my third year in university. My friend asked me whether I was 
      interested to join a mobile app development team, and I could do UE and 
      Product Management work. I feel lucky right now since I choose to accept 
      the invitation at that moment which helped me to get in touch with those 
      web/software things. So with the experience in that team, I became a real 
      product manager after I graduated and my first work lasted one year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one-year product manager work was not that cheerful. My boss pushed me
       a lot and I always stayed up late without extra pay. And my PM team had a
      bad relationship with developer team which made me disappointed. I thought
       to study aboard and learning what I didn't know is a challenge/opportunity.
      So I made my mind from the end of 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around this time last year, I didn't have a very clear career goal. But one
       day, I browsed my friend's own website and he showed me lots of tricks. I 
       suddenly these found attractive things were so interesting. And combining 
       with the current market, I thought why not to be a web designer. So I 
       chose to register web design relative classes and self-studied.
    </p>
    <p>
      This summer break, I had an internship in a local start up(<a href="https://www.fire-extinguisher.net/">Pyroweb.net</a>) working as front-end
      designer. Every time I finished the assignments, I felt very satisfied. 
      This experience really made me affirm my choice for sure.
