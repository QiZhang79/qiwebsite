      Hi, my name is Qi. I'm a graduate student majored in Information Architecture
      right now. And I choose Front-end Developer as my career goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I studied Advertising during my undergraduate period. Although I was not an
      engineer or science student, my interdisciplinary background still helps me a lot.
      For instance, my undergraduate major experience helped me to develop a sense of choosing
      attractive things, which pushed me to keep high standards for my own web design.

    <p>
      I have two important turning points for my career goal. The first one happened
      in my third year in university. My friend asked me whether I was interested to
      join a mobile app development team, and I could do UE and Product Management
      work. I feel lucky right now since I choose to accept the invitation at that
      moment which helped me to get in touch with those web/software things. So with
      the experience in that team, I became a real product manager after I graduated
      and my first work lasted one year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one-year product manager work was not that cheerful. My boss pushed me a lot
      and I always stayed up late without extra pay. And my PM team had a bad
      relationship with developer team which made me disappointed. I thought to study
      aboard and learning what I didn't know is a challenge/opportunity. So I made my
      mind from the end of 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around this time last year, I didn't have a very clear career goal. But one day,
      I browsed my friend's own website and he showed me lots of tricks. I suddenly
      these found attractive things were so interesting. And combining with the
      current market, I thought why not to be a web designer. So I chose to register
      web design relative classes and self-studied.
    </p>
    <p>
      This summer break, I had an internship in a local start up working as front-end
      designer. Every time I finished the assignments, I felt very satisfied. This
      experience really made me affirm my choice for sure.
